This leads to a smoother model in which the output changes more slowly as the input changes. \n",

    "When you shut some neurons down, you actually modify your model. The idea behind drop-out is that at each iteration, you train a different model that uses only a subset of your neurons.

    "\n",
    "### 3.1 - Forward propagation with dropout\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise**: Implement the forward propagation with dropout. You are using a 3 layer neural network, and will add dropout to the first and second hidden layers. We will not apply dropout to the input layer or output layer. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions**:\n",
    "You would like to shut down some neurons in the first and second layers. To do that, you are going to carry out 4 Steps:\n",
    "1. In lecture, we dicussed creating a variable $d^{[1]}$ with the same shape as $a^{[1]}$ using `np.random.rand()` to randomly get numbers between 0 and 1. Here, you will use a vectorized implementation, so create a random matrix $D^{[1]} = [d^{[1](1)} d^{[1](2)} ... d^{[1](m)}] $ of the same dimension as $A^{[1]}$.\n",
    "2. Set each entry of $D^{[1]}$ to be 1 with probability (`keep_prob`), and 0 otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** Let's say that keep_prob = 0.8, which means that we want to keep about 80% of the neurons and drop out about 20% of them.  We want to generate a vector that has 1's and 0's, where about 80% of them are 1 and about 20% are 0.\n",
    "This python statement:  \n",
    "`X = (X < keep_prob).astype(int)`  \n",
    "\n",
    "is conceptually the same as this if-else statement (for the simple case of a one-dimensional array) :\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "for i,v in enumerate(x):\n",
    "    if v < keep_prob:\n",
    "        x[i] = 1\n",
    "    else: # v >= keep_prob\n",
    "        x[i] = 0\n",
    "```\n",
    "Note that the `X = (X < keep_prob).astype(int)` works with multi-dimensional arrays, and the resulting output preserves the dimensions of the input array.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also note that without using `.astype(int)`, the result is an array of booleans `True` and `False`, which Python automatically converts to 1 and 0 if we multiply it with numbers.  (However, it's better practice to convert data into the data type that we intend, so try using `.astype(int)`.)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Set $A^{[1]}$ to $A^{[1]} * D^{[1]}$. (You are shutting down some neurons). You can think of $D^{[1]}$ as a mask, so that when it is multiplied with another matrix, it shuts down some of the values.\n",
    "4. Divide $A^{[1]}$ by `keep_prob`. By doing this you are assuring that the result of the cost will still have the same expected value as without drop-out. (This technique is also called inverted dropout.)"
