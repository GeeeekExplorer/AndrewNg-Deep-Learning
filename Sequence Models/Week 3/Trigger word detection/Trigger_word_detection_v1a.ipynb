    "    - Pick a random 10 second background audio clip\n",
    "    - Randomly insert 0-4 audio clips of \"activate\" into this 10sec clip\n",
    "    - Randomly insert 0-2 audio clips of negative words into this 10sec clip\n",
    "* Because you had synthesized the word \"activate\" into the background clip, you know exactly when in the 10 second clip the \"activate\" makes its appearance. \n",

    "* Suppose the synthesized \"activate\" clip ends at the 5 second mark in the 10 second audio - exactly halfway into the clip. \n",
    "* Recall that $T_y = 1375$, so timestep $687 = $ `int(1375*0.5)` corresponds to the moment 5 seconds into the audio clip. \n",
    "* Set $y^{\\langle 688 \\rangle} = 1$. \n",
    "* We will allow the GRU to detect \"activate\" anywhere within a short time-internal **after** this moment, so we actually **set 50 consecutive values** of the label $y^{\\langle t \\rangle}$ to 1. \n",

    "Implementing the model can be done in four steps:\n",
    "    \n",
    "**Step 1**: CONV layer. Use `Conv1D()` to implement this, with 196 filters, \n",
    "a filter size of 15 (`kernel_size=15`), and stride of 4. [conv1d](https://keras.io/layers/convolutional/#conv1d)\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "output_x = Conv1D(filters=...,kernel_size=...,strides=...)(input_x)\n",
    "```\n",
    "* Follow this with a ReLu activation.  Note that we can pass in the name of the desired activation as a string, all in lowercase letters.\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "output_x = Activation(\"...\")(input_x)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* Follow this with dropout, using a keep rate of 0.8 \n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "output_x = Dropout(rate=...)(input_x)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2**: First GRU layer. To generate the GRU layer, use 128 units.\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "output_x = GRU(units=..., return_sequences = ...)(input_x)\n",
    "```\n",
    "* Return sequences instead of just the last time step's prediction to ensures that all the GRU's hidden states are fed to the next layer. \n",
    "* Follow this with dropout, using a keep rate of 0.8.\n",
    "* Follow this with batch normalization.  No parameters need to be set.\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "output_x = BatchNormalization()(input_x)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3**: Second GRU layer. This has the same specifications as the first GRU layer.\n",
    "* Follow this with a dropout, batch normalization, and then another dropout.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4**: Create a time-distributed dense layer as follows: \n",
    "```Python\n",
    "X = TimeDistributed(Dense(1, activation = \"sigmoid\"))(X)\n",
    "```\n",
    "This creates a dense layer followed by a sigmoid, so that the parameters used for the dense layer are the same for every time step.  \n",
