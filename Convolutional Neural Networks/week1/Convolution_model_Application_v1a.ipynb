The third parameter ([1,s,s,1]) represents the strides for each dimension of the input (m, n_H_prev, n_W_prev, n_C_prev). Normally, you'll choose a stride of 1 for the number of examples (the first value) and for the channels (the fourth value), which is why we wrote the value as `[1,s,s,1]`. You can read the full documentation on [conv2d](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/nn/conv2d).\n",

    "- **tf.nn.max_pool(A, ksize = [1,f,f,1], strides = [1,s,s,1], padding = 'SAME'):** given an input A, this function uses a window of size (f, f) and strides of size (s, s) to carry out max pooling over each window.  For max pooling, we usually operate on a single example at a time and a single channel at a time.  So the first and fourth value in `[1,f,f,1]` are both 1.  You can read the full documentation on [max_pool](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/nn/max_pool).\n",

    "    * If a tensor P has the shape (m,h,w,c), where m is the number of examples (the batch size), it returns a flattened tensor with shape (batch_size, k), where $k=h \\times w \\times c$.  \"k\" equals the product of all the dimension sizes other than the first dimension.\n",
    "    * For example, given a tensor with dimensions [100,2,3,4], it flattens the tensor to be of shape [100, 24], where 24 = 2 * 3 * 4.  You can read the full documentation on [flatten](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/contrib/layers/flatten).\n",

    "#### Details on softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits (optional reading)\n",
    "* Softmax is used to format outputs so that they can be used for classification.  It assigns a value between 0 and 1 for each category, where the sum of all prediction values (across all possible categories) equals 1.\n",
    "* Cross Entropy is compares the model's predicted classifications with the actual labels and results in a numerical value representing the \"loss\" of the model's predictions.\n",
    "* \"Logits\" are the result of multiplying the weights and adding the biases.  Logits are passed through an activation function (such as a relu), and the result is called the \"activation.\"\n",
    "* The function is named `softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits` takes logits as input (and not activations); then uses the model to predict using softmax, and then compares the predictions with the true labels using cross entropy.  These are done with a single function to optimize the calculations.\n",
